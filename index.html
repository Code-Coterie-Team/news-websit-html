                        If you’re lucky enough to work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog to Work Day.” But most people aren’t, so today is the one day a year that many companies allow their employees to bring their pups with them. Some workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round!While it’s obviously not recommended for dogs to be brought to work sites that are dangerous for them or where they’ll get in the way, such as an operating room or a factory floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.

                    <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>

                    <p>here's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves. "Being on a New York City rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city, inside it, but at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says Chung.</p>
